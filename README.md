### Project Description

This project is a Web Application that checks for similarity between 2 or more documents and returns the results in a table.
The similarity checking was performed using Jaccard Similarity algorithm and MinHash similarity algorithm. Display of both input forms and results output is done through JSP pages with Http Servlets behind them. Application is hosted through local instance of Tomcat-9 server configured in Eclipse IDE.

### Project aim
I was trying to build this project with the idea that its parts should be reusable, loosely coupled and highly cohesive. I don't think I managed to achieve all the targets set to myself but I do believe that at least parts of the project worked out as intended.

### Javadocs

Project contains doc folder that contains generated JavaDocs files.
