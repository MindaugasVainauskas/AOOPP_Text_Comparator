### Project Description

This project is a Web Application that checks for similarity between 2 or more documents and returns the results in a table.
The similarity checking was performed using Jaccard Similarity algorithm and MinHash similarity algorithm.

### Project aim
I was trying to build this project with the idea that its parts should be reusable, loosely coupled and highly cohesive. I don't think I managed to achieve all the targets set to myself but I do believe that at least parts of the project worked out as intended.

### Javadocs

Project contains doc folder that contains generated JavaDocs files.
